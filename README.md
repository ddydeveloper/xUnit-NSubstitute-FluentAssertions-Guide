# Writing Unit Tests with xUnit, NSubstitute and FluentAssetions

It's really hard to overestimate the importance of testing. Let's imagine you are an engineer designing a railway bridge. You need to know the traffic flow, the materials it will be constructed, and many other factors. When it is finally done you can just allow a train to pass over the bridge to make sure it won't break...

You can't. The good news - you can follow this way as a software engineer! You can test individual parts, the whole structure, and even the entire flow with the train and passengers because of the 3 reasons:

- unit tests
- integration tests
- end-to-end tests

> Writing the tests makes your product reliable, raises the quality, reduces the time between code is committed and feature is delivered. It also makes you design code properly, especially if you are TDD adept.

In this repository you can find a test project with the number of unit tests written with [xUnit](https://github.com/xunit/xunit), [NSubstitute](https://github.com/nsubstitute/NSubstitute) and  [FluentAssertions](https://fluentassertions.com/).

You can also read an [article](https://hashnode.com/preview/6079aa6e767ccc06dae34fee) describing the approach.
